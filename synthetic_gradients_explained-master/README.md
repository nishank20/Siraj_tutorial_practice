# synthetic_gradients_explained
This is the code for "Synthetic Gradients Explained" by Siraj Raval on Youtube

## Overview

This is the code for [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qirjknNY1zo) video on Youtube by Siraj Raval on synthetic gradients. This is an optimization strategy DeepMind released that could overtake backpropagation. 

## Dependencies

* numpy

Use [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/) to install missing dependencies. 

## Usage

Both versions (backprop and synthetic gradient versions) have their own python file. Run them from command line using 

`python name_of_file.py` 

To run the notebook run this in the root directory

`jupyter notebook` 

Install jupyter from [here](http://jupyter.readthedocs.io/en/latest/install.html) 


## Credits

Credits for the code go to [trask](https://iamtrask.github.io/2017/03/21/synthetic-gradients/). I've merely created a wrapper to get people started.
